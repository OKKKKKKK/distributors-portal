# Backend Node Project

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to run the backend on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables.

4. **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment variables).

5. **Run tests (optional):**
    ```sh
    npm test
    # or
    yarn test
    ```

  npm run build
  # or
  yarn build
  ```

  ```sh
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```

Make sure to replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with the actual URL and directory name of your repository.
